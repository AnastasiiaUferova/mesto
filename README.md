## Description

This project is an nteractive gallery where users can share photos. This is a student project created during multiple sprints (4-9 sprints) of a web development course of Yandex Practicum. Trhoughtout these sprints, different layers of functionality were added to the project.

* Delete cards created by the user;
* "Like" and "dislike" photos;
* Expand the photos by clicking on them (pop-up shows up)
* Close the picture popup by clicking on "X", area outside of the photo or ESC button;
* Editing user profile information including name, description and avatar;
* Form validation on the client side;
* Communication with external API to fetch and patch/delete data

## Technologies:

* Adaptive layout using flexbox and grid positioning;
* Nested file structure according to BEM methodology;
